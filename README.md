# Impossible Button Clicker

## Description
This is a humorous and frustrating web-based game where the goal is to click a button. However, the button will move away from the user's cursor whenever they try to click it, making it extremely difficult and likely to make users aggressive while playing. The game features a timer, score tracking, moving obstacles, sound effects, random pop-ups with images, colorful backgrounds, fake error messages, random screen shakes, and a leaderboard.
